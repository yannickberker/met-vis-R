# Visualizing metabolomics data with R

This repository holds R code and plots supporting _Berker et al. (2022) NMR Biomed_, <https://doi.org/10.1002/nbm.4865>.

Find the plot source files to modify in [`R/source`](R/source), output plot files in [`R/output`](R/output/), and the manuscript file in [`TeX/output/manuscript.pdf`](TeX/output/manuscript.pdf).

## Prerequisites

To clone the repository and regenerate the plots, you will need Git ([git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)) and R ([r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org/), at least v4.1.0).

On Windows, don't forget to add R's binary directory - e.g., `C:\Program Files\R\R-4.2.1\bin\x64` -  to the `PATH` environment variable: type "Edit environment variables for your account" in the Start menu and append that folder to the `PATH` user variable, or compare instructions at [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/a/44272417). When successful, you should be able to launch R from any terminal or the "Run" command simply by typing `R`:

On Linux, you may need to install additional system dependencies. On Ubuntu 22.04, use

```shell
sudo apt install cmake libcurl4-openssl-dev libudunits2-dev libxml2-dev
```

In both cases, you should install at least one package in interactive mode to make sure there is a user-writable library location to install required packages to, e.g., running (within `R`)

```R
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

To also rebuild the manuscript, you will need a LaTeX distribution with `latexmk` installed (e.g., TeX Live, [tug.org](https://www.tug.org/texlive/), or MiKTeX, [miktex.org](https://miktex.org/)).

All operations can be run using [the command line](#using-the-command-line) or [Visual Studio Code](#using-visual-studio-code) (download at [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).

## Using the command line

```shell
git clone https://github.com/yannickberker/met-vis-R
cd met-vis-R
Rscript R/plots.R
latexmk TeX/manuscript.tex
```

## Using Visual Studio Code

In Visual Studio Code, after checking out the repository and opening the folder, you can also run the "Generate Plots" task, followed by the `latexmk` LaTeX Workshop recipe. Feel free to follow the sequence of screenshots below:

1. Hit `F1`, type `clone`, and select "Git: Clone"
